                Wash your hands. Ensure that the lenses are facing their proper
                application side. Lift your eyelid and apply to your eyes gently
                with a single finger. Roll your eyes backwards. To ensure
                product longevity, we recommend using our Youmi Beauty Lens
                Solution in a sealed immersion technique within the lens case.
                Replace the lens solution daily to ensure product cleanliness.
